Assignment_Week4_Getting and Cleaning Data_Readme.txt

This Readme report all necessary steps in the submited scripts involved in making a clean and tidy data set for week 4 assignment.

Included:
1) Preparing 'namesvector' for all 561 columes in the 'test' and 'train' data sets.
  - read.table was used to import "features.txt" file into Rstudio     to make the 'namesvector'
  - A new colume named "colnames" was created using mutate function to combine variation 1 and variation 2 in the "feature.txt" file to make unique names for all 561 colume names in the 'test' and 'train' data sets
  - Only the newly created colume was retained to make a charactor vector for later uses
  - Some cleaning was done with the 'namesvector' to make the names easier to read and manipulate by removing all the unfriendly charactors such as ")", "(", "-", ",". This cleaning will reduce the work need to carry out at requirement 4 of the assignment. This step was done using gsub fuction. 

2) Working with 'X_test.txt' data set
 - 'X_test.txt' data set was imported using read.table after setting the working directory to the folder where the file was located and assigned to a data frame 'X_testdata'
 - name 'X_testdata' with names function using 'namesvector' file created in the previous session.
 - 'subject_test' and 'activity_test' were generated from 'subject_test.txt' and 'y_test.txt' files from the original data set using read.table and were named "subject" and "activity", respectively.
 - add a colume "treatment" with charactor "test" to the 'X_testdata' to later differentiate data from 'X_test.txt' to 'X_train.txt'. 
 - cbind 'X_testdata' with 'subject_test' and 'activity_test' 
 
3) Did similar operations as in session 2 with 'X_train.txt' data set to create 'X_traindata'

4) Make 'alldata_raw' to merge the training and the test sets for the requirement 1 of this assignment using rbind of 'X_testdata' and 'X_traindata'.

5) For the requirement 2 of the assignment, 'alldata_meanstd' was generated using grep function all all rows having pattern of "mean|std". Since this step gets rid of all columes without "mean" or "std" in their colume names; the "activity", "subject" and "treatment" were added back to 'alldata_meanstd' using cbind with that particular three columes from 'alldata_raw'.

6) To name the activities in the 'alldata_meanstd' set with descriptive activity names, gsub was used to replace numbers "1", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6" with "walking", "walking_upstairs", "walking_downstairs", "sitting", "standing" and "laying", respectively  on the "activity" colume. 

7) Clean and descriptive variable names were generated by removing all the numbers, special charactors and making the "mean" and "std" more standing out and easy to read by replacing "mean" and "std" with "_mean" and "_std", respectively (this is for the requirement of question 4 of this assignment). The final version of the 'alldata_meanstd' was saved in the working folder as 'alldata_wk4.txt' using write.table function. This file can be loaded back to Rstudio again using read.table as indicated in the scrips.

8) For the requirement 5 of the assignment:
  - data frame 'alldata_wk4' created from the last step was melted using melt in "reshape2" package with id=c("activity", "subject", "treatment") and the rest will be measure.vars.
  - The melted data set 'alldata_wk4_melt' was then dcasted (dcast) with the id = "activity", "subject" and "treatment" with all other variables summarised using mean function. Data from this step was put in 'alldata_wk4_dcast'.
    - the 'alldata_wk4_dcast' was saved in the current working folder by write.table which can later be read as read.table function as indicated in the scrips. This data table was loaded to Github for grading.
